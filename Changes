Revision history for Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC::Async

0.06 2026-02-06
     [UNIT TEST]
     - Clean up unit test: t/04-plugin-async-operations.t
     [UPGRADE]
     - Updated the dependency on DBIx::Class::Async v0.55.

0.05 2026-02-05
     - [ENHANCEMENT] Keywords async_update and async_delete now support
       both scalar IDs and standard DBIC search HashRefs.
     - [ENHANCEMENT] All keywords now defensively handle optional
       $connection_name, defaulting to 'default' if omitted or
       if a HashRef is detected in the slot.
     - [FIX] Forced numeric context (int) for count, update, and delete
       returns to prevent string concatenation issues in tests and
       template logic.
     - [FIX] Updated internal signatures to prevent DBIC deprecation
       warnings when passing scalar IDs to search-based keywords.
     - [DOCS] Significant overhaul of SYNOPSIS and KEYWORDS documentation
       to clarify parallel execution patterns and deflated HashRef
       return types.

0.04 2026-02-05
     - Upgrade to DBIx::Class::Async 0.54 for stable resultset proxy support.
     - Internal refactor: Use DBIx::Class::Async::Schema as the primary bridge.
     - Improvement: Keywords now return plain Data (HashRefs/Scalars) instead
       of blessed Row objects to ensure compatibility with Dancer2's
       automatic JSON serialization.
     - Fix: Ensure IO::Async::Loop is maintained as a singleton state variable.
     - Updated test suite to use dynamic counting and JSON content negotiation.
